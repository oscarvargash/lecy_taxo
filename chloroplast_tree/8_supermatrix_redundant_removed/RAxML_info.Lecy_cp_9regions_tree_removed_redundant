IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 21 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file cp_regions.concat9.removed_redundant.fa.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
